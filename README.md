# Tree Tally

Tree Tally is an intelligent tool that harnesses the capabilities of YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection to analyze aerial views of forests. It accurately predicts the number of trees and classifies them into different species based on their diameters. Users can simply upload an aerial image, and Tree Tally generates a bar graph showcasing the distribution of tree species.

## Features

- **YOLO Object Detection:** Precise identification and location of trees in aerial images.
- **Species Classification:** Categorization of trees based on diameter for detailed species insights.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive web interface for easy image uploads and result visualization.
- **Bar Graph Visualization:** Clear representation of tree species distribution.
- **Downloadable Reports:** Comprehensive reports available in PDF formats.

## Getting Started
1. Download the zip file.
2. Run the command: `npm install` in your terminal.
3. Run the command: `node index.js`. If you have nodemon installed, use `nodemon index.js`.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`.
